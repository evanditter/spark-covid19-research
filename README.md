# Covid-19 Social Distancing Effectiveness Research using Spark

The main point of this project was to get familiar with spark. In doing so, I wanted to research something that was interesting at the time which was Covid-19. In particular, I was curious about social distancing efforts in each of the states in the US and how well it was working. In my results, I only had data up until April 28th, 2020 which was before many of the states stopped their social distancing, so much of the results were unclear, but the main point was to get familiar with spark.
